👋 Hi, My name is Nguyen Viet Hung. This is me:

_Me in a triathlon event_

🧑‍💻 I am currently a full-time open source contributor. Previously, I was working at [Got It](https://www.got-it.co/) as a Lead Frontend Developer.

⚡️ I am obsessed with Developer Experience (DX), so I created [jest-preview](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview) 🖼 to help frontend engineers to write and debug Jest tests effortlessly. If you are a frontend engineer, [check it out](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview). I promise you will love it 😍!

🗣 I sometimes speak at tech conferences (e.g: <https://2022.jsconf.kr/en/speakers/hung-viet-nguyen>) about DX, contributing/ building open-source projects, Frontend development, Testing... I would love to share what I know with other engineers, since that's the best way for me to strengthen my knowledge gap. If you are running a conference, I am open for a collaboration, just touch me via [contact](/pages/contacts).

🙌 I hope you enjoy my blog. You can reach me [here](/pages/contacts)
